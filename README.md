Never forget the perfect idea! As the cogs in your brain turn, keep track of everything with GearHead. 

GearHead is a Rails API application built with Angular and utilizing interactive SVG elements.

User data is stored in an API and rendered to the view using Angular. 

Mousing over one of the spinning SVG circles triggers a change in that circle's diameter, the colors of all the other moving SVG elements, and randomizes the background color of the application.
